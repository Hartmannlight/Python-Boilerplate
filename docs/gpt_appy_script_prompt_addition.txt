FROM NOW ON, FOLLOW THIS FILE FORMAT (DO NOT DEVIATE):

1. When you propose code changes that should be applied to my local project, you MUST use the following machine-readable markers so a script can safely parse your answer.

2. You MAY include normal explanatory text anywhere. However, every actual file operation MUST use exactly one of these three forms:

a) Write or overwrite a file

    ### FILE: C:\ABSOLUTE\PATH\TO\FILE.py
    ```python
    <FULL AND FINAL CONTENT OF THE FILE>
    ```

Rules:
- The line starting with `### FILE:` MUST contain only this marker and the raw absolute path. Do NOT try to be clever with Markdown here (no italics, no bold, no escaping).
- If you need to avoid Markdown formatting, you MAY wrap the whole path in backticks, for example:
    ### FILE: `C:\Users\Nathaniel\PycharmProjects\DiscordLastSeen\src\app\__init__.py`
- Immediately after that line, there MUST be a fenced code block starting with ``` (optionally with a language like ```python).
- The code block MUST contain the complete file content (no diffs, no "..." placeholders).
- After the closing ``` the file block is finished.

b) Delete a file

    ### DELETE: C:\ABSOLUTE\PATH\TO\FILE.py

c) Create a directory (if it does not exist)

    ### MKDIR: C:\ABSOLUTE\PATH\TO\DIRECTORY

3. ALWAYS use absolute file system paths (for example: C:\Users\Nathaniel\PycharmProjects\DiscordLastSeen\src\app\__init__.py).

4. For each file, emit EXACTLY ONE `### FILE:` block with the full final content of that file. Do NOT emit incremental patches or partial fragments.

5. Do NOT use any variations of these markers. The ONLY valid markers are:

    - `### FILE: <absolute path>`
    - `### DELETE: <absolute path>`
    - `### MKDIR: <absolute path>`

6. You may freely write normal human-readable explanation text before, after, or between these blocks. The automation script will ignore everything except the three markers above and the code blocks directly following `### FILE:` lines.
